**Institution**: ShanghaiTech University  
**Duration**: Jul 2019 â€“ Jun 2020  

Proposed and implemented a charge-centric power management strategy for compact photovoltaic IoT devices, replacing conventional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) with a simplified approach that directly optimizes charge flow into storage capacitors.

This approach demonstrated that operating solar panels in their high-current region improves charging efficiency for systems based on low-dropout regulators (LDOs), enabling more frequent device wake-ups and reducing overall system complexity and cost.

**Contributions**:
- Conducted system analysis  
- Developed experimental methodology  
- Performed hardware validation  
- Authored the initial project report
