**Institution**: ShanghaiTech University  
**Duration**: Jul 2019 â€“ Jun 2020  

Designed and implemented a battery-free sensing system for detecting the placement (landing) and removal (lifting) of heavy goods in logistics environments, powered by a custom Quasi-Static-Toggling (QST) energy harvester. The system stores mechanical energy from slow weight shifts and releases it in sharp electrical pulses, enabling an embedded controller to distinguish between landing (positive voltage spike) and lifting (negative spike). Detected events are transmitted wirelessly via Bluetooth, enabling real-time monitoring without external power sources or maintenance.

**Contributions**:
- Led system design and experimental validation  
- Developed detection logic  
- Conducted performance evaluation  
- Prepared the original draft
