**Institution**: Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)  
**Duration**: Sep 2017 â€“ Jun 2019  

Developed a battery-free wireless strain sensing system that harvests micro-scale ambient vibrations from building structures to power sensing and communication circuits. The system converts structural motion into usable electrical energy via a power management module and enables continuous Bluetooth-based data transmission for real-time structural health monitoring. This maintenance-free solution eliminates the need for wiring or battery replacement in long-term deployment scenarios.

**Contributions**:
- Conducted system-level design  
- Developed experimental methodology  
- Built and tested prototypes  
- Drafted the initial project report
